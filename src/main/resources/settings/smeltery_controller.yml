tick-interval: 20
fluid-reaction-per-second: 100.0
display:
  resolution: 8 # pixels per block; defines the resolution of the fluid display
  lightness-variation: 0.3 # defines the lightness variation of the fluid display; 0.0 is no variation, 1.0 is full variation

# Warning: physical constants. Don't mess with these unless you know what you're doing,
# lest you destabilize the heat simulation.
# If you *think* you know what you're doing, I would only adjust the heat loss coefficient
# and the emissivity.
specific-heat: # J/(kg*K); these define how fast the smeltery heats up/cools down
  air: 717.0
  fluid: 215.0
density: # kg/m^3; these define how much mass is in the smeltery
  air: 1.2
  fluid: 698.0
heat-loss-coefficient: 10.0 # W/°C; defines the rate of conductive cooling; i.e., cooling rate at low temperatures
emissivity: 0.9 # unitless; defines the rate of radiative cooling; i.e., cooling rate at high temperatures
room-temperature: 20.0 # °C; defines the temperature of the environment around the smeltery
