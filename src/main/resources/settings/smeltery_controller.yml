display:
  resolution: 8 # pixels per block; defines the resolution of the fluid display
  lightness-variation: 0.3 # defines the lightness variation of the fluid display; 0.0 is no variation, 1.0 is full variation
  lightness-speed: 1 # defines the speed of the lightness variation; 0.0 is no speed, 1.0 is full speed

room-temperature: 20.0 # °C; defines the temperature of the environment around the smeltery
heating-factor: 0.05 # unitless; defines how much the smeltery heats up per tick when under the target temperature
cooling-factor: 0.02 # unitless; defines how much the smeltery cools down per tick when above the target temperature

max-height: 16 # blocks; defines the maximum height of the smeltery
