## What is Pylon?
Pylon is an upcoming Minecraft Java plugin that will hugely expand vanilla gameplay with new content, including electric machines, huge multiblocks, a fully-fledged fluid system, a complex smelting system, extensive automation options and much, an (actually good) research system, and much more. It is intended to supersede Slimefun.

Pylon uses an addon system, meaning anyone can add content to Pylon by writing an addon for it! It also comes with a number of really useful features, such as:
- First-class translation support, meaning each player can select their own language.
- Extensive configuration options, including per-machine configuration. 
- An intuitive and user-friendly guide to help players figure out the plugin.
